In Postman, pass in the header and provide a value for it and make some requests.

Navigate back to the Dashboard and select the Log Browser to view detailed logging. Under Gateway Metadata, we can find the Tags attached to our request and should be able to see the header and value was injected as a tag.

This can be useful as you filter tags to gain additional information about how your API is being consumed.
